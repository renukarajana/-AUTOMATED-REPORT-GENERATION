*DESCRIPTION* :
1. Setting Up Your Environment
You first ensured that your computer had Python installed along with necessary libraries (fpdf or reportlab). These libraries help in generating PDFs without manual formatting.
2. Reading Data from a File
You selected a file containing data (CSV, JSON, TXT, etc.). Then, you accessed its contents by opening and reading the file. Depending on the file type, you either processed structured rows (CSV) or parsed text content (TXT).
3. Analyzing the Data
Once you had the data, you examined it to extract useful insights. You might have:
- Calculated summary statistics (such as averages, counts, or distributions).
- Identified trends and filtered key information.
- Organized data into sections or categories for a structured report.
4. Formatting the PDF Report
Using a PDF library, you created a structured document with:
- A title and headings for organization.
- Well-formatted sections with the analyzed data.
- Proper spacing, fonts, and alignment to improve readability.
5. Exporting and Reviewing the Report
After formatting the content, you generated the PDF and saved it. You then checked the document to ensure everything was structured correctly before sharing or storing it.
